Each image oclussion label has the following structure:

occ_info.mask:
  comtaining the corresponding mask for instance id and class id

occ_info.OrientMap:
  comtaining the orientation of each pixel on the edge.


For validation set, we picked around 1000 images from voc 2010 as in val_doc_2010.txt

Actually, after ECCV submission, we found it might not be satisfied to evaluate over
the validation set since many of the images only contain a single object in pascal, though
we found interesting results from the occlusion relationship of internal edges. We are
now trying to re-select the validation set for better evaluation.

In addition, it is promising combining such low level cues with high level object
knowledge to achieve much better and reasonable results.

For BSDS:

We convert the FG labelled results to our orientation representation for learning
and visualization.
